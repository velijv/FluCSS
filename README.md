  <summary>ðŸŒ“ Color palette</summary>

## Color palette
Colors are modeled by dividing sun states into 4 groups â€” but you can add more variation if you need.

### Overlay color
Overlay color has eliminated blue channel - rgb(200,125,0) - keeping red and green, while maintaing contrast between background and text.

All color combinations pass the [WebAIM Color Contrast Checker](http://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/). Click on each color to validate. 

### Normal mode
Start value: pure white, End value: pure gray (middle between black and white), with 2 equal distance steps in between. Overlaid by #c27c00.

### Full black night mode
Start value: pure white, End value: pure black, with 2 equal distance steps in between. Overlaid by #c27c00. Last 2 background colors get white text.
