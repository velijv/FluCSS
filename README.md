# [FluCSS by Veli](http://veli.ee/flucss/)
CSS styles based on sunset and sunrise for visitor location. Like [F.lux](http://justgetflux.com/), for the web.

_Demo does not work on Chrome, because geoLocation must be served over https. If your project has https, works fine_

## [Preview demo](http://veli.ee/flucss/)

Easier on the eyes for night-time reading, useful for blogs and newspapers by eliminating blue light. Read more on [F.lux website](http://justgetflux.com/).

Options: Dimmed at night, Full black at night 

## How it works:
1. Get your location (latitude, longitude) via HTML5 Geolocation API
2. Find sun states for location via SunCalc js
3. Calculate closest sun state for current time
4. Add CSS class on any element based on closest sun state


## How to use it:
1. Include jQuery
2. Include [SunCalc js](https://github.com/mourner/suncalc)
3. Include flucss.js and flucss.css

##Color palette
Colors are modeled by dividing sun states into 4 groups â€” but you can add more variation if you need.

###Overlay color
Overlay color has eliminated blue channel - rgb(200,125,0) - keeping red and green, while maintaing contrast between background and text.

All color combinations pass the [WebAIM Color Contrast Checker](http://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/). Click on each color to validate. 

###Normal mode
Start value: pure white, End value: pure gray (middle between black and white), with 2 equal distance steps in between. Overlaid by #c27c00.

###Full black night mode
Start value: pure white, End value: pure black, with 2 equal distance steps in between. Overlaid by #c27c00. Last 2 background colors get white text.
